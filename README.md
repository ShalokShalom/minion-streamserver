# Minion StreamServer

This is the server for the Minion system that directly communicates with minion agents, feeding telemetry and data from those agents to appropriate end points.

The seed for this server has been taken from https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger as there is a lot of fundamental overlap between what Analogger already does and what the StreamServer needs todo.
